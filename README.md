## Introduction
Choloepus is a flexible gripper driven by a three-phase motor with Field-Oriented Control (FOC).

## Performance & Features

- Capable of lifting **3kg of water**
- Capable of delicate operations such as **picking up a needle** or **gripping an eggshell** ([video demo](https://youtu.be/MMdkBzw2Btk))
- Maximum drive current: **2A**
- Drive voltage range: **12V ~ 24V**
- Supports three control modes:
  - **Force closed-loop** (current loop)
  - **Position closed-loop**
  - **Hybrid force-position control**
- Weight: **300g**

## Mechanical Structure

Except for the motor and the depth camera, all other components were designed in-house. They can be fabricated via 3D printing and basic mechanical processing. You can find the models and engineering drawings in the `/0.Model` directory.

## Firmware

This projectâ€™s firmware is developed with PlatformIO under the Arduino framework.

We have built upon the open-source project [SimpleFOC](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-drivers) and made optimizations to drive the flexible gripper with FOC control.

The firmware is located in `./2.Frimware`.

## Communication

At the bottom of Choloepus, there is a 4-PIN XT30 connector that supports a DC input voltage of **12 ~ 24V** and **CAN bus** communication.

In the `/3.Software` directory, you will find a Python library that lets you create a Choloepus object and establish communication:
```python
my_gripper = gripper(serial_port='COM10', id_num=20)
```
Choloepus supports different control modes, shown below:
| **Control Mode**            | **Command Frequency** | **Interruptible by New Commands** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Position Control**         | < 250Hz               | Yes                               |
| **Force Control**            | < 50Hz                | Yes                               |
| **Hybrid Force-Position**    | < 20Hz                | Yes                               |
